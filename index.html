            <p>Hey there! You enjoy music, right? Maybe you happen to enjoy live music aswell? You've probably got some amazing memories of the concerts you've attended? Would you like to share how many bands you've seen live and find new friends that have
                the same taste in music as you?<br /> <b>Then you've come to the right place!</b></p>
            <p>This is a website that helps you conveniently keep track of the bands and singers you've seen live, take notes on when it happened, who were you with, how you liked it and so on. You can find people that went to the same events or find new
                concert buddies for the future, if that's what you're looking for.</p>
