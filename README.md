## ðŸ“š About

* Proof of Concept (POC) website
* Created in IT College first year as a personal project during the first front-end subject. Got grade 5 (A).
* Done using minimal and plain HTML, JS and CSS
* Design has this nostalgic 90s feel, actual website would need modernization :stuck_out_tongue:
